To demand full openness all the way down (including, say, materials within devices within a circuit board) is extremely hardcore, and if that were the only level of certification available, would limit open hardware certification to a tiny niche (for some time into the future). A scale would permit organisations or projects striving to be open, but perhaps not all the way there, to start out with some recognition for their efforts (community support, interest in products etc), and to still have a gold standard to work towards.</p>\n<p>We should also remember that the certification goals are not to set the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for open hardware (which might point towards a single definition), but to make open hardware, in essence, easier to engage with (without diluting the principles).</p>\n<p>Tiers or nutrition/laundry label could both give a clear sense of direction for projects starting out with some level of openness, in terms of being clear what was more open and therefore desirable.  Tiers do this transparently; a modular labelling system would need to be clear about how to compare two labels from a consumer point of view.</p>",

I would like to +1 the comments by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lbj20\">@lbj20</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/aharper\">@aharper</a>.  I think they have each identified an axis of openness.  I think <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lbj20\">@lbj20</a> has identified an axis describing how far down the open source description applies: down to the atoms, down to the components, down to the sub-assemblies, at the system level, some mix of the above depending on what sub-system/component one is discussing, etc.  I think <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/aharper\">@aharper</a> has identified an axis describing who may have access to the source based on legal restrictions: citizens of country X, citizens of countries X, Y, and Z, everyone, etc.</p>\n<p>The blog post that anchors this discussion mentioned the Creative Commons in the background of this question.  That reminds me of another axis of openness we should discuss, namely the items that the Creative Commons and software licenses address, things like:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Attribution Only vs Share Alike</li>\n\t<li>Library Style Licensing (LGPL) vs Standard Licensing (GPL)</li>\n\t<li>\n<del>Non-Commercial</del> This one has been thoroughly discussed, including it for completeness sake)</li>\n\t<li>Are there others that I am missing? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I bring this axis up for discussion because in my experience working as a software professional in several small businesses, industry will often not touch share-alike IP, but will happily work with attribution only (or even LGPL code) IP and share patches to the originating project.  And I personally believe this kind of project adoption is essential if OSH is to have the same kind of impact FOSS has had on the world (and I very much want to see that happen both in general and to support the mission of <a href=\"http://mach30.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mach 30</a>).</p>",

If OSHWA do so, will it be aligned with FSF, and what if it is not ? Will it generate a sort of \u201cpublic war\u201d which will decrease the value of OpenSource Hardware.</p>\n<p>If so, that means the definition of Openness for tangible things, should certainty be done across a participative work on progress with free/libre/openness software definition cursor makers (FSF, CC, P2P, \u2026).</p>\n<p>Last but not least, on Single or Option concepts for hardware openness definition: currently, open hardware licenses do not include the software developed, alongside/included in, the work of progress of an open hardware. Or, sometime, this software is part of the hardware. Then, some of us, are currently writing new terms and conditions, or have already contracted, under terms of open hardware licence including a mechanism making the software automaticaly published under terms of listed free/libre/opensource software licenses.</p>\n<p>What does it mean, and why to connect this to openness definition for hardware ? That means the definition should clear the fact that an hardware could be made with non-hardware components, and if those components are developed/published under an openness process as fully part of an opensource hardware process development, then those non-hardware components should also be published under openness terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>Then, that will have a consequence: as CERN-OHL as TAPR-OHL will have to include software inside their articles, and make a bridge with free/libre/opensource software license by default as this for example:<br>\n\u201cWhen people elaborate, an Hardware Creation made with both software elements and non-software elements, then those software elements are provided under the terms and definitions of one of the GNU-GPL compatible license officially listed by the FSF\u201d</p>\n<p>A definition, single, with options or not, with categories or not, will have effects on legal terms and conditions.</p>",
