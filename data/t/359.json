Nevertheless, I believe the goal of the (self-)certification is that it should be possible also for non-lawyers to be able to answer these kind of questions.</p>\n<p>Looking at: <a href=\"http://certificate.oshwa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://certificate.oshwa.org/</a></p>\n<p>What I read is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create products that comply with the community written open source hardware definition hosted by OSHWA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This definition is found here: <a href=\"https://www.oshwa.org/definition/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.oshwa.org/definition/</a></p>\n<p>Which reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design. The hardware\u2019s source, the design from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hardware must be released with documentation including design files, and must allow modification and distribution of the design files</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(continuing quoting from <a href=\"http://certificate.oshwa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://certificate.oshwa.org/</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ensure that all of the creator\u2019s own contributions to an open source product using the certification mark are shared as open source in accordance with the agreement and these requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ensure all parts within the creator\u2019s control are open source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As noted above, in order to be certified under this program all parts, designs, code, and rights under the control of the creator must be made open according to the open source hardware definition hosted by OSHWA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My conclusion from all this: if the .sch is the standard \u2018source file\u2019 of EAGLE and it is required to have that .sch file in order to study and modify the design and if publishing the .sch file is under the control of the creator of the design, then the .sch file should absolutely be included for the item to be regarded Open Source Hardware. And not doing so, would violate the OSHWA Certification.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Hi Rudolph.  Let me try and shed a bit more light on how we try and answer this question.  As noted already, the definition essentially requires documentation (including files) to be adequate to allow downstream users to use and build upon the hardware.</p>\n<p>While that is an easy principle to state, it can be hard to apply in any specific situation.  Adequacy can vary based on the type of hardware, the types of files involved, and the types of knock-on activity that users would want to engage in.</p>\n<p>Since OSHWA knows that we will never have the in-house expertise to evaluate every situation ourselves, we rely on the community to help us work through issues.</p>\n<p>For example, we have had community members raise concerns about various pieces of certified hardware.  At the time of certification it appeared to the review team (which does not necessarily have expertise in a given area of hardware development) that there was adequate documentation and files for users.  However, a community member with deeper expertise in the area raised the concern that the documentation and files were not actually adequate for the types of uses that should be possible under the definition.</p>\n<p>In response to these concerns, we usually work with the community and the party responsible for the original certification to update the documentation.  If the responsible party is able to update the documentation to meet the certification requirements, we consider the issue to be resolved.  If the responsible party is not able to meet what appear to be reasonable requests from the community, we may revoke certification.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry that does not give you a specific \u201cwe require X\u201d type answer. I hope that it does give you a better understanding of the process, and even a sense of why there is not a single answer to that important question.</p>",

The point is to provide the public with all documentation needed to produce the hardware, change the hardware and redistribute those documents while aiming to assist the public in doing so, meaning not only enabling to do so but also making it easy to do so. This especially includes not holding back documents that already exist and play a significant role in reachung the goals mentioned above. If adding the document to a release does not add more unnecessary noise than it does to reach those goals it should be added. The license must be permissive.</p>\n<p>Depending on the projects nature such files can be, but are not limited to, schematics, layouts / boards, 3D / CAD models, BOMs, lists of known good sources of materials and instructions.</p>\n<p>I hope my approach is of any use. To me the question is one of intention amd ethics, not legal definition. There is plethora of \u2018open washed\u2019 projects out there that are closed commercial projects, confusing users about the nature of open source and open hardware. This is detrimental to the perception of open *, especially the perception of value open * holds.</p>",
