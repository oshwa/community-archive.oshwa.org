From my perspective, the members of the OSHWA are trying to make a genuine effort to represent the will of the community, be transparent in their operation and promote open source hardware.  There is a much larger risk of bad actors cashing in on the good will of the community by claiming to be open source hardware but not actually being so.  This is happening right now (as of this writing) on a at least one KickStarter campaign and happens with fair regularity.</p>\n<p>Enabling organizations, like the OSHWA, to hold companies accountable to the claims they make is part of making a fair and open market.</p>",

Seems pretty backwards to me.</p>\n<p>I never said that OSHWA is corrupt in the slightest, in fact I like the work they\u2019ve done in educating people up to this point. But I am telling you as someone with a licensed professional engineering background that once you go do the road of \u201ccertifications\u201d it becomes a money grab more than trying to promote better behavior and best practices. Just take a look at the metric crap ton of IT certifications and other quasi-engineering certification (LEED, CEM) that have popped up over the years. They have done absolutely zilcho to actually provide better quality to customers, they simply exist to feed themselves. The point is, you may start off with the best of intentions, but eventually a bureaucracy becomes self-sustaining even after it\u2019s outlived it\u2019s usefulness. And in this case, I question the usefulness at the outset. Consumers barely understand the difference between iOS and Android, look at the debacle with Microsoft and their Windows 8 versus Windows 8 RT problems. Open Source Hardware is way more obscure and unfortunately the average consumer just doesn\u2019t care. Those in the maker and professionals space,s people who do care, are smart enough to know the difference. My point is the community of people that is actually interested enough to know the difference between OSHW and non-OSHW is smart enough to know the difference and we don\u2019t need a nanny state-style certification to do this. Lastly, and perhaps most critically let\u2019s say you do create a certification. What mechanism do you use to enforce it? Do you really want the governments of the world to regulate this industry that has become the cradle for innovation and STEAM education? Seems to me it will kill OSHW vice save it.</p>",

I\u2019ll still make my designs available and offer educational opportunities showing people how to design and build properly.  Regulations/certifications tend to hurt us small businesses and can be really discouraging as one more thing to do or pay for.

The FSF is motivated by purity of a clear moral standard. The RYF cert literally forbids a seller from using badge that says \u201cworks with windows\u201d because it lends legitimacy to windows and also stipulates that the seller has to reference \u201cfree software\u201d more often than they reference \u201copen source.\u201d They want to prevent as many projects as possible from being able to qualify so that the RYF cert means the project is absolutely perfect, up to and including the assertion that if free software for a secondary processor ever becomes available in the future, and the seller doesn\u2019t build a fix or a whole new version to allow access to that secondary processor, the FSF will revoke the RYF cert.</p>\n<p>Open source split off from free software specifically because it focuses on maximum usefulness rather than maximum freedom. It would be inappropriate and counterproductive for an open source cert to be exclusionary.

I found it very thoughtful and inclusive.</p>\n<p>While not responding to each question below, these do seem topics worth pondering and warranting some consensus \u2013 many helpful comments and thoughts have already been posted. There are many matters that represent gray areas for which there is no perfect stance, and for which input, experience, and experimentation may be the best approach. But getting conversation going seems highly constructive.</p>\n<p>I particularly like the draft\u2019s stance on self-certification. I can easily imagine a check list that allows the producer of a piece to OSH to complete a questionnaire that will allow anyone to see how the hardware in question complies or does not comply with important OSH tests and allows the designer/producer to respond with the compliance details and rationale for deviations. Such information would be pretty straightforward for users/observers to validate and would allow anyone with any interest in the item to understand the producers position.</p>\n<p>There are two issues of particular concern to me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With respect to the matter of different categories of certification; care needs to be taken in with any scaling of level or degree of \u201copenness\u201d. Not that the notion does not have some applicability, but there remain aspects of open licensing around which there are reasonable differences of opinion that would not make for appropriate litmus tests. For example, from my own perspective, \u201cpermissive\u201d licenses are more open and less coercive than \u201ccopyleft\u201d licenses. But, I appreciate that others do not necessarily see it that way. It would seem to me to be a mistake to consider one or the other of these approaches as higher or lower on a certification scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The question of whether an \u201copen\u201d piece of hardware may contain non-open components \u2013 as noted by others here \u2013 creates a lot of awkwardness because most any project is going to contain proprietary components. Any sort of list of how much in a project is or is not open is likely to be problematic to assess and characterize. I\u2019m wondering if there is not some sort of way to take into account the breadth of a hardware design, considering what is under the purview of the designer/producer \u2013 that is, the unique stuff that is being served up in the offering. If what the designer/producer is contributing by way of design and innovation in the offering is fully open (ie. designer\u2019s hardware plans, manufacturing info, and access all levels of software representative of the unique contribution) no matter what proprietary parts might be specified in the BOM, then that seems to me a strong case for \u201copen hardware\u201d. One should be able to make the thing from the available information. If, what the designer can share in a collaborative way is not fully shared (e.g. not providing low-level firmware that has been created for the offering and is part of it uniqueness), then it would seem to me the case is only for qualified openness. As an example from the software world, there can be a fully open apps, that run in Windows; there can also be entirely-closed, proprietary apps, that run in linux. Of course, we want to believe that starting with linux is a better way to go \u2013 as starting with fully open hardware components might be a better way to go for OSH \u2013 but for me, the questions of the handling of components that are central to the purview of the design seem the crux of the matter.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For any who might be interested in the approach we have taken in handling OSH and the licensing of Handibot, please see recent post:   <a href=\"https://handibot.com/panaka-license.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://handibot.com/panaka-license.php</a></p>\n<p>Ted Hall, Handibot/ShopBot</p>",

The most important factor is to only consider the things the designer has control over.
