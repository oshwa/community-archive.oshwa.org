        "cooked": "<p>I\u2019m neither a lawyer, nor programmer, just a paralegal in previous life, but a couple of things I will say about this, Firstly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GNU_General_Public_License</a> and other Open Source licenses address this with fairly typical legal disclaimers. This is why some say it\u2019s fairly important to actually include such licenses, (and force people to click on them) in any product: software, hardware or firmware, instead of just releasing a product into the Public Domain. Please get as much familiarity as possible before using them. Read Them! Again, I\u2019m no authority on GNU licenses, and I believe there\u2019s not actually much testing of the legal validity of Open Source licenses in courts (case law is supremely important in Common Law \u201cEnglish\u201d type systems, like in the US, Canada, Great Britain, etc. Your responsibilities in Civil Law systems, as in much of Europe, may be different.) Secondly, in the US, the point of going after designers is when they have deep pockets- when the manufacturers and sellers don\u2019t. One of the reasons there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot of case law on Open Source, is the designers are often penniless, or at least not as wealthy as manufacturers, etc\u2026 Not good targets for lawsuits, although that\u2019s no protection, as someone with a grudge or agenda might not care about the money, and/or have more of interest in bankrupting or putting you out of business. I mention this only to remind you to keep things in perspective, since any professional opinion you solicit might be inspired by their own business interests, and give only the most alarmist hypothetical situations. If you have no money, you\u2019ll be small, if not invisible, to lawyers in the vast majority of cases. And most people will not be interested in putting a designer of products for the physically disabled out of business, and a good lawyer will point out the small-mindedness of such attempts if s/he can.<br>\nThe GNU people have put a lot of thought into such matters as legal responsibility: it\u2019s one reason their on Version 3, instead of leaving the first version alone. Check out the language in it sometime, instead of clicking mindlessly, as we often do, me included.</p>",

So what are the rules to establish liability in the Netherlands are different from say the UK or Canada.<br>\nWhich is great for lawyers cuz it keeps them busy but not so great for a community like ours who are trying to figure stuff out without messing up in the process <img src=\"//community.oshwa.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"><br>\nSecond problem is that a lot of it is written in legalise (read confusing or broad terms) open to interpretation and as a result you will hear us say \u2019 it depends\u2019 a lot, but that\u2019s the reality I\u2019m afraid that it does depend on a specific situation and it\u2019s not possible to tell beforehand what the outcome will be. You can get some advice on it and Christopher and Laura made some good remarks already.<br>\nI would say it is unlikely you can be held liable under any jurisdiction simply for providing blue prints for a device when you have attached a license with a clear disclaimer and someone unknown to you uses your design. (This reminds me a bit of the liability discussion for 3D printing guns) To avoid any liability I would make sure that you make this clear when publishing your designs that people are responsible themselves for any damages done by using the designs. The situation may be different if they actually contacted you and you knew your design had flaws and didnt tell them about it (duty of care).</p>\n<p>Sorry I dont have time right now to do a full legal analysis but hope this helps a bit</p>\n<p>best<br>\nF</p>",
