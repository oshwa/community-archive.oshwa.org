(IT Admins can create DNS CNAME alias, so data flows to the intended host)<br>\nRFID: cheap, low-power, low-interfering RFID solution (MCRF?) that will quickly and precisely identify when equipment is inserted and removed and send this via HTTP to hostname=racktrack (within 1 second).<br>\nRackTrack will use 6U \u201cmain-unit\u201d (POE/DHCP/HTTP/Temperature/Humidity/RFID sensors) and connect with 4U+6U RFID \u201csensor-units\u201d thereby supporting all even-U sized racks ranging from 6-54U (only 8U not supported). RackTrack will be placed right next to the rack mounting holes. Small RFID tag-holders will be screwed into the same mounting holes as the equipment and hereby connect to the specific RFID sensor. RJ45 interface on main-unit will be located in the top facing out (taking up the space of the top 2 sesors than are redundant), allowing RackTrack to be placed in either side of the rack.<br>\nRackTrack will easily identify equipment down to each 1/3U (main-unit: 6U=16 sensors ; sensor-units: 4U=12 sensors, 6U=18 sensors) - making it truly authentic, as each U has 3 mounting holes.<br>\nRackTrack will have led lights for easy troubleshooting (no RFID UID detected=led off;RFID UID detected=green led; RFID selftest failed=red led).<br>\nRackTrack can be used on both front and back on racks to track \u00bd depth equipment such as top-of-rack switches, etc.<br>\nRackTrack will have clear U-number (01-54) and sub-U-character (A,B,C) markings, as it will be installed where these are on most racks.<br>\nRackTrack could (v2 ?) support E-ink displays - receiving image URL from racktrack host (RFID UID not linked to host=RFID UID detected, but no image url=yellow led).

        "cooked": "<p>So I realize your post is semi-old-ish\u2026 but not as old as Inter-Switch Link was when Cisco finally admitted they lost and killed it.  I see a lot of potential in what you are trying to do.  Most mid-sized/small data centers can not commit to full packaged DCIM platforms.  At that most are modular with almost zero chance of figuring out what is needed (Unless you work for them\u2026 looking at you Solar Winds\u2026 what the hell is per virtual core physical node basic licensing anyway?  It is like everyone waiting for Oracle to sue them for because we can not figure out how to license something that doesn\u2019t exist).  Almost everyone I have seen either gives up or hires a consultant to fix it\u2026 and within a year is back to zero.  So even when they try\u2026 they still fail.</p>\n<p>Typical Customer Conversation</p>\n<p>Customer : I have heard of this cool thing called \u201cinsert Software Solution\u201d and it only cost 3.99 a month!</p>\n<p>Me : Yeah.  3.99 a month for per node connectivity without additional services or configuration</p>\n<p>Customer : Oh cool!  So I must just be a single node!  Lets do it!  Cheap and easy!</p>\n<p>Me \u2026</p>\n<p>Customer : Oh, by the way.  Have you figured out my baseline?</p>\n<p>Foundationally physical control is the start point of security.  If it can be touched, it can be owned.  (Anyone remember renaming the CMD.exe to Utilman.exe?)  We have all heard stories of the root bridge being in the closet of a branch office.  Or the 16 year old guy that broke the iPhone hours after release.  Or the annoyed Admin looking for live boot disk and being annoyed it isn\u2019t their \u201cfavorite\u201d distro as they break every known security measure Linux or Windows has to offer?)</p>\n<p>90 plus percent of failed infrastructure processes could be avoided by proper asset management.  Raise your hands if you have ever been somewhere that has the most beautiful CM process ever written, super great patching policies, great lifecycle documents\u2026 and the first server you touch has some Heartbleed level exploit available because they never attached the hardware to the policy?  (Looking at you DoD, every Federal/state GOVT CIO\u2026 great policy too bad you don\u2019t follow them, I just left Amy\u2019s Cupcake Factory and her POS network is more secure\u2026 good luck on air gap and Security Through Obscurity)</p>\n<p>Sadly the worst environments for \u201cbaseline\u201d tracking tend to be the small security enclaves.  (Hey Lockheed, that is a super nice advanced fighter jet China is flying.  What is it called? Is that the F-22 Raptor, opps, nope, must be the MV-22 Osprey, ahh rats\u2026 here, just take the F-35.)</p>\n<p>What I am saying is I see a LOT of potential for what you are proposing here.  I think it needs a lot of up front conversations, the biggest conversation is often the tools of the good guys become the tools of the bad guys.  Knee jerk reactions often mean organizations have already banned the tech that could save them\u2026 how can that be overcome? Tell most Security Mangers you are about to deploy RFID tags and they will get their \u201cfaraday cage\u201d wallets and tin hats, totally forgetting how they just opened the door.</p>\n<p>A very legit strategy is to use same tech but call it something different, no one checks anyway, that is effort.</p>\n<p>Company : We use SMART, Super Modern Asymmetrical Relay Technology, to deliver a super fast stream of information.</p>\n<p>Customer : TAKE MY MONEY</p>\n<p>Everyone else : Wait, did they just sell UDP as their own product</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Google : Hey guys we just made this thing called QUIC and we are awesome, it is free (Please ignore the data scraping)</p>\n<p>The World : Thank you for SAVING us from slow internet</p>\n<p>Everyone else : Wait, did you add ARQ to UDP? Or just improve TCP with fewer acks?  Wait!  Isn\u2019t TCP just UDP with built in ARQ anyway\u2026 so is it both?</p>\n<p>The group who open sourced KCP : FML</p>\n<p>I have never collaborated with anyone.  I have been content to toil alone of one off passion projects usually as a passive aggressive way to show disapproval.  Usually when someone insists the company buys something for an insane amount, I disagree, so I build one for under 100 dollars to show my displeasure.  But I have turned over a new leaf.  It is time to be friendly and add to the community that I have borrowed from so many times.  (Real Talk does anyone actually write anything for microcontrollers or do we all troll Github looking for the right header and source files to throw into our project\u2026 lord I am lazy\u2026 but thank you Peter H\u2026 your C++ is soooo clean)</p>\n<p>So if I am not too late\u2026 and you haven\u2019t given up.  And you can deal with a very lazy engineer that usually has to read 50 wiki pages to remember something he thought he once already knew before remembering he did the same thing a year ago, documented it, forgot his own naming convention, and just went with it anyway\u2026 got a semi-decent results before asking for peer review, being upset by the blunt feedback of half-assery, then locks everyone out of the DC, shutting down TACACS, and goes home to cry.  (final steps, blame your friend who had NOTHING to do with it and pretend like everything is alright, wait for MGMT to be confused by all the nerd babble, more confused non-punishment because no one can actual explain what you did to anyone with the power to fire you, wait for someone else to screw up so you can stop paying for the drinks)</p>\n<p>Also obviously just a little bitter and jaded.  Some how I forgot to lose my native idealism so it hurts anew every time when I fail articulate my ideas for funding because a) I was to technical b) My white paper wasn\u2019t in PowerPoint with pretty pictures c) The VP of Development\u2019s Daughter saw a viral Tik Tok about some new thing we really should be doing (involves data transfer via dance?) d) Tech Crunch just published an article about something with no practical application to the current problem but they DID mange to include pictures e) My Best Friend is still pissed at my last antic and refuses to stop me from publicly drowning.</p>\n<p>If all that is alright with you\u2026</p>\n<p>Then I would love to help you.</p>\n<p>Yeah yeah\u2026 I know I went way off point.  I could have said that up front.  Somehow this post became about me and not the project, Sorry?</p>\n<p>If you have moved on\u2026 I get it\u2026 Still I haven\u2019t had a good nerd rant after a crap week at work for awhile\u2026 So thank you.</p>\n<p>PS I still find the time to be an optimist, love my work, and enjoy the beauty of something newly created, still get annoyed when something works and I have no clue why, still mess with it until I break it again, still take the time to laugh at how dumb I am, and try to keep all the fresh faced engineers away from MGMT so they are not lured in or destroyed</p>\n<p>(To the mod that is about to remove this post, take mercy, it is Friday night if you catch my drift)</p>",
