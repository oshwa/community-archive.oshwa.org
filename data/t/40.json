        "cooked": "<p>This is a tricky question. Of course, if OSHWA has to evaluate every request for certification that would, we hope, take a great deal of effort due to many projects opening up in the future! Thinking about fees might well be needed.</p>\n<p>However, the risk of self-certification is that some projects claim the certification without meeting the requirements, either through malice or ignorance, and if such a project attracted media attention it could significantly dilute or damage the OSHWA/open hardware brand and concept.</p>\n<p>Depending on the community response on other questions it might be worth looking at a hybrid model. Let us assume a spectrum of certification is available.  Lower tiers, say \u201cbronze,\u201d might be available for self-certification, but the \u2018gold\u2019 tier might require formal submission and evaluation by OSHWA.  This top tier process may or may not require fees, and may require projects to supply a portfolio of supporting evidence (to cut down OSHWA effort!). Projects failing to submit appropriate documentation could have their applications rejected with minimal effort.</p>\n<p>The pre-approval process which enables \u2018gold standards\u2019 to be maintained could also be something limited, say, to projects which were looking at serious scale (whether commercial or otherwise). This would mean small projects could still get self-certified to a high standard of open hardware-ness, but if they were deploying some larger number of units from a central source then the pre-approval extra-strong certification would be strongly recommended, as this would help such projects demonstrate their seriousness in the market/community. This would cut the risk of a large scale project maliciously self-certifying and then bringing the open hardware movement into disrepute, as any large scale project would be required to be formally checked if it wanted to use the certification.</p>\n<p>For comparison, I would point at the work of the Open Definition Advisory Council. This group evaluate licences which wish to be considered as compliant with the Open Definition (and also are stewards of the Open Definition itself).  Because licence proliferation is a bad thing, and licences are designed for reuse, this should be a finite job; there are not an ever-increasing list of new licences to evaluate and never will be. Openness can grow and thrive without more licences being approved, so the manual process is OK. It also adds value as there are subtleties around language and interpretation of both licences and Open Definition at times where discussion and consultation is very valuable. The Open Definition is carefully policed, therefore, with every licence being checked before approval, and as a \u2018gold standard\u2019 and a binary open-or-not, this is important for the future of open.</p>\n<p>However, OSHWA faces a very different situation. We wish to see more open hardware, and therefore more products which are certified (if certification is chosen). The number of projects/products requiring certification is something we want to see grow. We also hope that compliance is something reasonably clear and not subject to debate about language or subjective argument. So a manual process of evaluation is not so good - except, perhaps, for a small subset of potential open hardware projects, where the effort required adds value (and ideally can be compensated in some way).</p>",

I have a few small open source projects of my own and don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of asking permission from the OSI to use their trademarked logo even though my software is fully free and open.</p>\n<p>My belief is that the risk of bad actors self-certifying as being open source hardware is low.  If through ignorance they\u2019ve certified themselves as being open source hardware when they\u2019re not, a gentle reminder to either remove the certification or comply with the open source hardware definitions will probably solve most cases.  In the few cases where bad actors refuse to remove the certification but won\u2019t comply with the open source hardware definition, litigation can be pursued.  I imagine this to a be a rare and extreme case, only pursued when all other options have been explored.</p>\n<p>I believe that it\u2019s better to trust that most people who want to put the open source hardware certification on their projects are genuine about their intention to be open source hardware compliant.  My bet is that giving the community the benefit of the doubt will go much further than bogging down certification with approval processes and fees attached.</p>\n<p>I also think simpler is better.  Having people differentiate between bronze, silver and gold seems like it will just dilute the idea.  My feeling is that it\u2019s better to have one certifications that will give a clear signal.</p>\n<p>I would be for adding an additional level of certification on top of being open source hardware compliant.  Something like \u2018OSHWA approved\u2019, maybe with the text \u2018OSHWA\u2019 and a check mark next to it.  This could have fees attached as to get OSHWA approval as there would be a need to process and approve an application.  I hope I\u2019m not being pedantic but for the end consumer, the little sigil or small piece of text on a PCB is the thing they see.  If the sigil or text on the PCB isn\u2019t distinct enough, confusion follows.</p>",
