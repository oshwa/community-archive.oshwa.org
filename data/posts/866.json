Jo has a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology and worked for approx. 10 years as a postdoc research scientist. Mostly in the field of plant responses to the environment. Will has a mathematics PhD and also currently works as a staff member in the biology and biological engineering department at Caltech where he designs and makes custom hardware and software mostly used by grad students and postdoc researchers for their lab and field experiments.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all for now!
