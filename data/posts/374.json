The badge circuit boards will be pick-n-place assembled by a professional assembly service. A test jig will need to be created for the assembler to test the badges.\n\n**Hardware tasks:**\n- reproduce the ESP trINKet design in KiCad _(Mike Rankin's design was done in Altium)_\n- modify the ESP trINKet design to use 3x AAA for power instead of LiPo\n\n**Design tasks:**\n- create an atheistic design for the badge including artwork and shape\n\n**Software/Firmware tasks:**\n- proof of concept demo on ESP32 using BLE to set the text on the e-paper display\n\n**Production/Supply Chain tasks:**\n- decide on which e-paper display to use _(current choice is Waveshare 2.13\" display)_\n- create a plan for provisioning the badges and how the badge wearer will connect to their badge over BLE\n- talk with assembly company to figure out best way to assembly badge with epaper display _(use connector or directly solder the ribbon cable)_\n\nThanks!\nDrew\n<drew@oshpark.com>",
