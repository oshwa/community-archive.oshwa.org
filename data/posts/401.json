In 2016, we convened for the first time at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland and then in Santiago, Chile for GOSH 2017.

We will conduct a series of themed discussion groups, practical workshops and trips to local Shenzhen businesses that can offer lessons and support for scaling Open Science Hardware. GOSH has potential to broaden who can do science and for what purposes in addition to improving quality and reproducibility of experimental observations. We invite you to be a part of the Gathering and the GOSH Community.\n\nGOSH\uff08\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u786c\u4ef6\u5927\u4f1a\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u5168\u7403\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u52a0\u5f3a\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u8bf7\u7533\u8bf7\u53c2\u52a0\u6211\u4eec\u57282018\u5e7410\u670810\u65e5\u81f313\u65e5\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u6df1\u5733\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u5c4a\u5e74\u4f1a\uff01\n\n\u786c\u4ef6\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6807\u4ef7\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u9650\u5236\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u786c\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6750\u6599\u5230\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\n\nGOSH \u5c06\u4e8e2018\u5e74\u5728\u6df1\u5733\u5c55\u5f00\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u5e74\u4f1a\uff0c\u53ec\u96c6\u4e86\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u6b63\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u79d1\u5b66\u8fd0\u52a8\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u4eec\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6700\u591a100\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\uff0c\u6d3b\u52a8\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u6db5\u76d6\u6700\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u5168\u7403\u601d\u60f3\u9886\u8896\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u53ec\u96c6\u4eba\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6269\u5927\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002\n\n\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5c06\u7ec4\u6210\u4e00\u8d77\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u52a0\u8fd9\u6b21\u76844\u5929\u63a2\u7d22\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u6211\u4eec\u76842018\u5e74\u4e3b\u9898\"\u6269\u5c55\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u793e\u533a\"\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5f00\u5c55\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e3b\u9898\u8ba8\u8bba\u5c0f\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u62dc\u8bbf\u6df1\u5733\u7684\u5f53\u5730\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u786c\u4ef6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u548c\u4e3a\u6269\u5927\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u786c\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u652f\u6301\u3002GOSH \u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6b21\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u4ee5\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53c2\u52a0\u5230\u79d1\u5b66\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u53bb\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21\u5c06\u4f1a\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8bda\u9080\u60a8\u6210\u4e3a GOSH \u7684\u4e00\u5458\u3002",
