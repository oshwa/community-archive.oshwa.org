Open Source Hardware is way more obscure and unfortunately the average consumer just doesn\u2019t care. Those in the maker and professionals space,s people who do care, are smart enough to know the difference. My point is the community of people that is actually interested enough to know the difference between OSHW and non-OSHW is smart enough to know the difference and we don\u2019t need a nanny state-style certification to do this. Lastly, and perhaps most critically let\u2019s say you do create a certification. What mechanism do you use to enforce it? Do you really want the governments of the world to regulate this industry that has become the cradle for innovation and STEAM education? Seems to me it will kill OSHW vice save it.</p>",
