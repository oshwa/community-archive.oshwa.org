Although the current certification process does not address this specific senario, an idea came to me that hopefully will get some consideration. A very quick answer to the \u201csituation\u201d is that both the creator and the company will have joint rights to the product\u2019s certification. Which given this idea, it also raised the question of who should be registering the product idea with OSHWA?
