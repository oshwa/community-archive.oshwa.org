If what the designer/producer is contributing by way of design and innovation in the offering is fully open (ie. designer\u2019s hardware plans, manufacturing info, and access all levels of software representative of the unique contribution) no matter what proprietary parts might be specified in the BOM, then that seems to me a strong case for \u201copen hardware\u201d. One should be able to make the thing from the available information. If, what the designer can share in a collaborative way is not fully shared (e.g. not providing low-level firmware that has been created for the offering and is part of it uniqueness), then it would seem to me the case is only for qualified openness. As an example from the software world, there can be a fully open apps, that run in Windows; there can also be entirely-closed, proprietary apps, that run in linux. Of course, we want to believe that starting with linux is a better way to go \u2013 as starting with fully open hardware components might be a better way to go for OSH \u2013 but for me, the questions of the handling of components that are central to the purview of the design seem the crux of the matter.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For any who might be interested in the approach we have taken in handling OSH and the licensing of Handibot, please see recent post:   <a href=\"https://handibot.com/panaka-license.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://handibot.com/panaka-license.php</a></p>\n<p>Ted Hall, Handibot/ShopBot</p>",
