          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>A general remark about the initiative of looking into certification: I think it great that you are doing this and my opinion is that there should be an FSF RYF-kind of certificate for open hardware.</p>
<p>My plan was to get into the discussion on this forum and reply to all questions asked. However, I noticed this is taking way too much of my time. Answering only 1 question, responding to other answers, takes me about an hour. So all questions take me more than a working day.</p>
<p>If there will be events where the topic is discussed, I would prefer to participate there. Way faster and easier than doing it online in a forum. Sorry.</p>
<p>Best of luck and I am looking forward to the outcomes!</p>
