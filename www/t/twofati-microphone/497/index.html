          <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<pre><code>I came up with a great microphone design, built it and 
</code></pre>
<p>have been using it for more than a year.<br>
The mic sounds great, obeys all laws of physics, and is turning out to be quite useful.</p>
<pre><code>My plans are to build and sell these mics.

I've looked at the patent process here in the USA and from what I can tell 
</code></pre>
<p>it is expensive to both get and then defend a patent.<br>
As a person of modest means who believes in the Open Source concept,<br>
innovation and sharing, Iâ€™m looking at Open Source Hardware Certification.</p>
<pre><code>Document Copyright, Trademark and Licensing issues are also under consideration.

In an ideal world: 
</code></pre>
<p>)  Lots of people would buy mics from me,<br>
)  I would be credited with the initial idea,<br>
)  My project name would go with all mics made by me and other builders, and<br>
)  I would be paid a modest sum for each mic made from this design by other builders.</p>
<pre><code>Am I being realistic?
</code></pre>
<p>Product invention, development and sales are new worlds for me;<br>
Any guidance you can provide will be appreciated!</p>
<pre><code>This is my first post here  ~  thanks to those making 
</code></pre>
<p>Open Source Hardware Certification a Reality.</p>
<p>Thanks and good health,  Weogo Reed</p>
