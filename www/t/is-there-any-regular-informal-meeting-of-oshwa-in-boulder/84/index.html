          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m a french IT engineer in holiday for a short time in Boulder, CO until the 31 of march.<br>
I used some of my free time in the last day to sensibilise myself ( a little bit more…) on sustainable development issue. It looks to me that the OSHWA is exactly about that, applied to the IT / electronic world.<br>
I like it, and I would love to know more about what you are doing.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure lots of information are already available on your website. However,I would like to seize the opportunity of directly meeting some members of this association since I am in Boulder and there is nothing like a good old IRL discussion <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
<p>Some word about me:<br>
I am interested in network and telecommunication technologies, which are often a good mix of hardware and software. Besides that, i like photography, open source software, inline skate and blizzard video game.<br>
If someone want to meet for an discussion , please let me know here. We will figure it out .</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>Nicolas</p>

          <p>Hi Nicolas,</p>
<p>There aren’t any official OSHWA meetings in the area but there is a thriving Open community in Boulder and the surrounding area. If you check out MeetUp you might be able to find a group of like-minded individuals while you are in town. This should be a good place to start <a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/opensource/us/co/boulder/">https://www.meetup.com/topics/opensource/us/co/boulder/</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m out of town until the 30th and probably won’t be able to meet up with you while you’re around as I’m down in Aurora <img src="/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Best of luck! I hope you are able to find a group to meet up with while you are in town!</p>
