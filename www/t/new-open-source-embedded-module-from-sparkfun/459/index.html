          <p>This morning, the SparkX Team at SparkFun released the first open-source, OSHWA certified, embedded-systems module that allows users to integrate the TensorFlow machine-learning platform into any design. The team also released three carrier boards that already have the module: BlackBoard Artemis; BlackBoard Artemis Nano; and BlackBoard Artemis ATP.</p>
<p>To learn more about the project, the following resources will be helpful:</p>

<p>This type of project is interesting because it is the first module SparkFun has designed AND it is the first open-source module available on the market. “Our goal is to enable anyone to integrate low-power machine learning into their designs and projects without being locked into a specific toolchain,” said SparkFun founder and engineer, Nathan Seidle, “The Artemis module is the first product to bridge the gap between hobbyists and consumer products, providing a single module from prototype to production.”<br>

<p><strong>Artemis Module Details</strong><br>
Beyond its small size (15.5 x 10.5mm including antenna), key features of the ultra-low-power Artemis module include:</p>
</li><li>Cortex-M4F based BLE module using the Apollo3 microcontroller from Ambiq
</li><li>Advanced HAL (hardware abstraction layer) allowing users to push the modern Cortex-M4F architecture
</li><li>Capability of running machine learning algorithms with the low current consumption of 6μA/MHz at 3.3V
</li><li>Integrated Bluetooth 5 low-energy radio and 2.4GHz antenna
</li><li>All necessary circuitry for easy integration—large SMD pads and spacing allow for low-cost 2-layer carrier board implementations; programming over pre-configured serial bootloader or JTAG
</li><li>ISO7816 Secure ‘Smart Card’ interface
</li><li>Secure firmware update system
</li><li>Flexible serial peripherals
</li><li>Rich set of clock sources
</li><li>Camera capable
<p><strong>What About the Three Carrier Boards?</strong><br>
The three carrier boards provide fairly familiar form factors and enable anyone to flex the capabilities of Artemis module. All three boards:</p>
</li><li>Have a digital MEMS microphone for experimenting with always-on voice commands with TensorFlow and machine learning
</li><li>Have built-in BLE radio
</li><li>Are fully compatible with SparkFun's Arduino core and can be programmed easily under the Arduino IDE  (SparkFun wrote the core from scratch)
</li><li>Have an exposed JTAG connector for more advanced users who prefer to use the power, flexibility, and speed of professional tools
</li><li>Include Qwiic® connectors for easy prototyping and daisy-chain capabilities for the Qwiic ecosystem, which includes 70+ sensors, outputs, and controllers
<p>The SparkFun BlackBoard Artemis comes in the Uno footprint and is a good entry point for working with the Artemis module; the BlackBoard Artemis Nano is the smallest form factor of the three boards and offers great flexibility for smaller projects; and the Blackboard Artemis ATP (“all the pins”) breaks out all 48 GPIO of the module and allows users to leverage the full capabilities of the module.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps For This Project?</strong><br>
SparkFun is currently seeking FCC/CE approval for the Artemis module, which will be released as shielded modules and will be available in tape-and-reel quantities. The Engineering Version released today, allows users to get started as soon as possible. Once approved, having a module that is both FCC/CE certified and OSHWA certified is most definitely a first.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we sharing this project with the OSHWA community?</strong><br>
Typically, embedded modules are not open source and they lock users into a particular toolchain. Additionally, the gap between prototype and production is clunky at best. We hope the OSHWA community will 1) use the module and/or the boards with the module to create awesome projects and products and 2) share the module with others.</p>
